# IIIT

This repository contains all the assignments, labs, and projects completed by me during my time at IIIT-Hyderabad.

The repository is organized by courses, with each course having its own directory. Inside each course directory, you will find the following:

- Assignments (if any) : Folder containing all the assignments done during the course.

Feel free to explore the repository and access the code and documentation for each course.
