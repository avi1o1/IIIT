<!--I can teach you a concept, I myself learnt 2 hours ago, fueled by my 4am caffeine induced self hatred.
    But God help me when it's an ISS Assignment on topics I first heard, seconds ago.

    But, here we go. What can possibly go wrong...

        <p style="color: white; background: green;">
            Embarking on a crash course [ *cough* ISS *cough* ] with the expectation of becoming an instant expert is like thinking a microwave turns
            you into a master chef. Sure, you can speed-cook your way through a tutorial, absorbing information like a sponge on steroids, but let's
            not kid ourselves. The road to expertise isn't paved with dummy-dum-dums looking for shortcuts. It's more like a scenic route where you savor
            the nuances, not a speedy expressway where you end up confusing "algorithm" with "Al Pacino's rhythm." So, to all the crash-course enthusiasts
            out there, here's a friendly reminder: expertise is a slow-cooked dish, not a microwavable dream.
