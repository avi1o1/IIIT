# Root Page (./) #
Application's Landing Page, where the user is prompted to input username, mail and password. The data is stored in a users.txt local file.
Passwords are stored only in the encrypted form.

# ./success/<username> #
If the ID creation is succesful, this confirmation page prints a suitable message.

# ./user/<username> #
Retrieves the data of the given username. Passwords are still displayed in encrypted format.


# Assumptions #
None. Have kept in mind almost all the instructions, and have succesfully implemented all functionalities. However, I have not worked
on any CSS or JS files (primarily to give focus on ISS Assignment, and also because of time constraints). Apart from that, everything should work fine (unless, I misunderstood some functionality, and have implemented a different approach to what might be expected).
